# cover-uploady

reminder to create a `env.py` file next to `__main__.py`, and in it define a `SECRET` string and a `PORT` int. it can be whatever you want, you need to send the SECRET along with your request to upload the image in the POST req as a `secret` parameter.

i'll probably write a better readme some day. if you use this in prod not for personal purposes -- you will be shot on sight.
